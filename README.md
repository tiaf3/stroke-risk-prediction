# Stroke Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a robust machine learning pipeline to **predict stroke risk** based on clinical and lifestyle features.  
Achieved up to **97% accuracy** using **Random Forest** classifier.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Models Used**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Random Forest  
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Missing value imputation
  - Label encoding
  - SMOTE for class balancing  
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC Curve

## Pipeline Overview

1. Data cleaning and imputation
2. Categorical encoding
3. Train-test split (70/30)
4. Class balancing with **SMOTE**
5. Model training & evaluation
6. Result visualization and comparison

## Results

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall     | F1 Score |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Random Forest       | 96.64%   | **98.58%**| 94.68%     | **96.59%** |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 92.84%   | 88.54%    | **98.50%** | 93.26%   |
| Logistic Regression | 77.99%   | 76.63%    | 80.91%     | 78.71%   |

- **Top Features**: Age, Hypertension, Smoking Status

> **K-Nearest Neighbors** achieved the highest recall (98.5%), important for detecting most stroke cases, but its lower precision caused more false positives.
> **Random Forest** showed the best balance with high precision (98.58%) and recall (94.68%), making it the most reliable overall, especially for medical use. 
> **Logistic Regression** served as a simple baseline but was less effective.
> 
> Therefore, **Random Forest** is recommended as the primary model, with **K-Nearest Neighbors** as an option when maximum sensitivity is needed. Future work should focus on further tuning and clinical integration.
